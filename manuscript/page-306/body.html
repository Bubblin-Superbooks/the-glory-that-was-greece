The most popular of all these “skolia” was “The Myrtle Bough.” One version of it runs:</p><p>“I will wear my sword in a myrtle bough,<br>Like Harmodius and Aristogeiton<br>When they killed the tyrant<br>And made Athens free.</p><p>“Dearest Harmodius, thou art not yet dead.<br>They say thou art in the Isles of the Blessed,<br>Where dwells Achilles swift of foot<br>And Diomede, Tydeus’ son.</p><p>“I will wear my sword in a myrtle bough,<br>Like Harmodius and Aristogeiton<br>When at the sacrifice of Athena<br>They killed Hipparchus the tyrant lord.</p></div> </div>
